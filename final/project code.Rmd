## Project - Movie



```{r}
movies <- read_csv("D:/24092014/Joven/UNI STUFF/DBA3803/Final Project/final/csvfiles/tmdb_5000_movies.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
